Networks 3D is a software under development, built to construct and interact with graphically appealing visualizations of large complex networks. Its main objective is to provide means for researchers and specialists to see and get a visual overview of the data they are working with. The tool is based on a optimized force-directed algorithm, which is used to project the networks to a 2D or 3D space, presenting results generated by the graphical processing unit in real-time.
