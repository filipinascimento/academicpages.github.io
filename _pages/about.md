# Research
My interests include developing and implementing new techniques for analyzing, modeling, and understanding real-world systems through complex networks, machine learning, and data visualization. In particular, my current focus is on the development of a new network visualization software named Helios and on Science of Science research.

# Experience
The approaches I proposed have been applied to a wide range of scientific areas, including bioinformatics, text analysis, science of science, information science, and urban networks, leading to many publications and softwares. I also have experience giving talks about network science and visualization in workshops and undergraduate classes.
